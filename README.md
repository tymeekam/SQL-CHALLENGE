# SQL-CHALLENGE
Itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period were six CSV files!

For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. I will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively. Run the queries and obtain the answering respectifully.
